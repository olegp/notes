# Notes

Notes is an example of a [Common Node](http://olegp.github.com/common-node/) application using [Stick](http://github.com/olegp/stick/) and [Mongo Sync](http://github.com/olegp/mongo-sync/).

To try it out, you will need to have Common Node installed globally (via `npm install common-node -g`) as well as MongoDB running on localhost.

Then, simply:

    git clone git@github.com:olegp/notes.git
    cd notes
    npm install
    common-node .

From the browser, navigate to http://localhost:8080/ to see the webapp in action.
